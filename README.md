# HTML5 Testcard

**[See demo](https://makigas.github.io/testcard)**

Just a webpage that renders a testcard with a clock pattern. I use it on my
livestreams while I'm setting up before starting. You can give it a try using
the public website.

## Usage

The most basic form is just accessing the index.html file.

However, by using the `banner` param in the URL querystring a fixed test can be displayed on the top
half of the screen. Example:
