# HTML5 Testcard

Just a webpage that renders a testcard with a clock pattern. I use it on my
livestreams while I'm setting up before starting. You can give it a try using
the public website.

### Using with OBS

Install Browsersource:

* CLR Browsersource for OBS for Windows: https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/clr-browser-source-plugin.22/
* Browser Plugin for OBS Multiplatform: https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/browser-plugin.115/

Add the public page as the website to display.

### TODO

* Replace the PNG file with scalable vector graphics for extra smoothing.
  (Right now the testcard is an scaled 480p picture).
